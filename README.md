# Portfolio Budget Statements ontology

***This is a placeholder - this ontology has not yet been developed***

This ontology is an [OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) interpretation of the Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS) that are delivered online in their document form at <https://www.budget.gov.au> and as data at <https://www.data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-2fe0ab1a-3161-477a-9175-5c829d80afab/details?q=Budget%20statements>.

This ontology imports some of its definitions from other ontologies, both international standards (e.g. the [Organization Ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/)) as well as Australian government ontologies (such as the [Commonwealth Record Series (CRS) Ontology](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/crs)).

This ontology will be published online at a persistent URI namespace web address:
